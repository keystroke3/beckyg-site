      <h3>
        Early Life
      </h3>
      <p>
        Becky G's real name is Rebbeca Marie Gomez. She was born on March 2 1997 in Inglewood, California.
        Gomez grew up in Moreno Valley, and at the age of nine her family lost their home and moved into 
        the converted garage of her grandparents' house due to financial problems. Gomez began working
        part-time jobs to help support her family, doing commercials and voice over work. She had what
        she described as a "mid-life crisis" when she was nine years old, and decided she wanted to pursue a
        music career. She was quoted as stating "That was literally my mid-life crisis when I was nine
        years old. That's when I felt like, 'OK, I gotta get my life together. What am I gonna do?' I pushed
        that on myself at a younger age than the average kid because at the time my family had lost our home.
        I've always been more mature for my age, so I was already understanding what they were going through.
        And I just thought, 'How can I help them?'" She initially attended public school, though had to undergo
        home schooling due to issues with bullying. She claimed that at one point she was jumped by multiple girls
        while in the restroom, and was a frequent target due to her jobs in the entertainment industry.
